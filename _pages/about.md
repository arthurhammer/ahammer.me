Hi, I'm [Arthur]({{ "/about" | relative_url }}). I'm a Computer Science student and I write software. You can find a few of my projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/{{ site.author.github }}). Sometimes I write on [my blog]({{ "/blog/" | relative_url }}), usually about small hacks that make my life a bit easier. You can [contact me here](mailto:{{ site.author.email }}).


## This site

This is a simple static website built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). It is [open source]({{ site.repo }}).
