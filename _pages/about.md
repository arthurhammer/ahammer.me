Hi, I'm Arthur.

I'm a Computer Science student, [iOS developer]({% post_url 2018-12-08-frame-grabber %}), trail and ultra marathon runner, juggler, [trail joggler]({% post_url 2019-02-05-trail-joggling %}), and all around [fiddler]({% post_url 2018-06-19-counting-mountain-summits-with-strava %}). Sometimes I write on [my blog]({{ "/blog/" | relative_url }}), usually about small hacks that make my life a bit easier. Some of my projects are [open source]({{ site.author.github }}), including [this website]({% post_url 2018-05-28-this-site-is-open-source %}).

[Contact me via email](mailto:{{ site.author.email }}).
