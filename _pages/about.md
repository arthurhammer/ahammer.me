Hi, I'm Arthur, Computer Science student, iOS developer, trail and ultra marathon runner, juggler, [trail joggler]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-02-05-trail-joggling %}), and all around fiddler. Sometimes I write on [my blog]({{ "/blog/" | relative_url }}), usually about small hacks that make my life a bit easier. Some of my projects are open source and on [GitHub](https://github.com/{{ site.author.github }}). [Contact me via email](mailto:{{ site.author.email }}).

[This site is open source]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-05-28-this-site-is-open-source %}).
