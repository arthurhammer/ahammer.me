[As promised]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2014-12-01-hello %}), I'm sharing my first tiny thing.

When you copy a link to a Google search result, Google hijacks it with an internal redirect link. Instead of `www.wikipedia.org`, you end up with something like `www.google.de/url?sa=t&rct=j&qâ€¦` on your clipboard. This is obviously quite inconvenient if you want to share or otherwise reference that URL.

[I whipped up a userscript][download] that disables this so you always get the direct link to the search result.

It took a while finding the source of the redirection in Google's Javascript. The culprit is a global function `rwt`. To disable it, the userscript simply defines an empty [non-configurable](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/defineProperty) function with the same name `rwt`. The key is the non-configurability which makes it impossible for Google to override our empty `rwt` function with theirs.

Works like a charm.
