Here are three tiny changes to Wikipedia that improve my enjoyment of the site immensely. I've been using them since I created them back in 2016 and I'm still in love. They're in the form of userscripts if anybody even remembers what that is. Anyway, let's go.

## Quick Language Switcher

Changing the language of the current article is one of my most-used features on Wikipedia. I read articles in English and my native German. Sometimes the English version of an article has more information, sometimes the German one. I constantly switch between them to complement and cross-reference.

However, changing the language is clunky. The language list is buried deep in the sidebar. The list can be long and it changes from article to article. Finding your target language can take a while, if it is even available at all.

I [made this userscript](https://github.com/arthurhammer/userscripts/tree/master/Wikipedia_FavoriteLanguages) that adds links to your favorite languages right above the article's title. You can't miss it. Configure your languages in the script.

## Ditch the Sidebar

With the languages moved out of the sidebar, there is nothing interesting left in there. I never look at it. In fact, I find it clutters the site and makes reading harder.

I ditched it with [this userscript](https://github.com/arthurhammer/userscripts/tree/master/Wikipedia_ToggleSidebar). Don't worry, if you need the sidebar, it is not gone. You can quickly toggle it by clicking on the triangle button.

## Quiet Links

[This one](https://github.com/arthurhammer/userscripts/tree/master/Wikipedia_QuietWiki) is a bit more esoteric. [I wrote about it some time ago already]({% post_url 2016-12-01-quiet-links %}).

It lets you hide links, making the page feel calmer. Wikipedia is filled with an absurd amount of links. Sometimes, it is hard to focus on the current article with all those links around. For me, it provides a bit of peace and quiet to focus on a single article. I don't use this one too often but I'm still glad it's there when I do need it.

## Summary

There you have. Three simple changes that make a lot of difference for me when reading Wikipedia.
