description: This site is now open source.

I wanted to have this done a while ago. When I first made this site, I threw it together in haste and hesitated in putting it out there. I finally got around to cleaning up the site, properly putting it under version control and updating the deployment process.

There's still not much to this website. It is a handful of text files and images, some HTML, CSS and a config file mashed together with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) to produce what you see here.

Anyway, it's done: [The repository is on GitHub]({{ site.repo }}). If you find any typos or errors, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
