This will be my place on the internet. For what exactly I don't know yet.

Over the last few years, I have created many small projects and hacks that have made my life a weeny bit easier. I have learned a bunch and had many thoughts and ideas. But I have never really put those things down somewhere, for me or others to see. It all just floats away.

Part of it is being afraid, of not feeling ready. That doesn't mean I shouldn't start anyway. I want to put stuff out there, even if it is tiny and insignificant and nobody cares. I want this to be a place to document all this, where I allow myself to experiment and to suck so I can learn and grow from it.

Along the way, I might even contribute something back to this world.
