A year ago I released my first iOS app, [Frame Grabber](https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/frame-grabber/id1434703541?l=en&mt=8). I wrote about how I made it [here](/2018/10/frame-grabber/).

Since the release, I've never touched it again. I actually had plans for versions 1.1 through 1.3. But while I was using it day to day I realised I didn't need any of that stuff. It's a utility app and it does what it's supposed to very well. Bug reports from active users were lacking and features that were requested were out of the scope of the app. Nothing to do!

One thing I also didn't do is look at the analytics page in App Store Connect. Let's do it now:

The app is free, so no moneys there. Apart from that, I had no expectations. I didn't do any marketing, I barely announced the app to my friends. I was pleasantly surprised to discover it took up a small but active user base. Downloads are slowly growing.

One thing I'm especially proud of: Not one single crash in the entire year!

The dry spell is over, however. iOS 13 is around the corner and it brings a ton of changes Frame Grabber needs to support. I'm excited to dig back into the code base and bring it up to speed.
